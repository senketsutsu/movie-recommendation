We use Cleora:
- website: https://www.cleora.ai/
- documentation: https://cleora.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- source code: https://github.com/BaseModelAI/cleora

Instead of compiling Cleora from source, you can download a pre-built executable from the releases page.

On Windows, you may need to manually add `.exe` extension to the filename.
